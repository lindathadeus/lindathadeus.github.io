Hi Everyone,
This is a post about my thoughts on the set of jobs that will be present after the genesis of the AI era. 

The introduction of AI has shown the world that the average knowledge work does not have to be too costly, much like when the Industrial Machines showed the world that the average hand-made product does not have to be too costly.

Let us look at it deeper, what constitutes an average work? IMHO, whichever doesn't require deep thinking constitutes an average work. In other words, whichever can be regurgitated using patterns from existing knowledge base, can be put inside the "AVERAGE BOX".

But does it mean every knowledge job out there will be made by AI? NO!, what I mean is whichever is not too costly for the customer and even cheaper than the man's pay, will be taken over by AI. Because, AI is fast and scalablle unlike human beings.

So, who are under risk? The highly paid average knowledge workers.

So, who are safe? The lowly paid knowledge workers, The knowledge workers of unexplored knowledge (Ph.D folks, Niche specialist, Emerging Technology Knowledge Workers)

What do you think? Mail me your comments.

Cya!
