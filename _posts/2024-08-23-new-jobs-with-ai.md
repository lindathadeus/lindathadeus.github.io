Hi Everyone,

This is a post about my thoughts on the set of jobs that will be present after the genesis of the AI era.

The introduction of AI has shown the world that average knowledge work does not have to be too costly, much like when industrial machines showed the world that the average hand-made product does not have to be too costly.

**But what constitutes average work?** 

In my humble opinion, whichever doesn’t require deep thinking constitutes average work. In other words, whichever can be regurgitated using patterns from an existing knowledge base can be put inside the "AVERAGE BOX."

But does it mean every knowledge job out there will be made by AI? **NO!** What I mean is whichever is not too costly for the customer and even cheaper than the man’s pay will be taken over by AI because AI is fast and scalable unlike human beings.

**So, who is under risk?** The highly paid average knowledge workers.

**So, who is safe?** The lowly paid knowledge workers, the knowledge workers of unexplored knowledge (Ph.D. folks, niche specialists, emerging technology knowledge workers).

### AI's response:

Your insights form a solid foundation for understanding the evolving job landscape in the AI era. Let's explore a few additional dimensions to enrich the conversation.

#### **Clarifying 'Average Work'**

You've defined "average work" as tasks that don't require deep thinking and can be replicated through patterns. This is an excellent way to frame the discussion. To make it more relatable, consider providing examples: routine data analysis, content generation based on templates, or handling straightforward customer service queries are all tasks that AI can perform efficiently.

#### **Job Security Beyond Low Pay**

While it's true that lower-paid knowledge workers might not be the first to be replaced by AI, there's more to job security than pay. Adaptability, continuous learning, and the ability to collaborate with AI are becoming increasingly crucial. Workers who can integrate AI into their workflow, regardless of their pay scale, will likely be more secure in the long run.

#### **Niche and Emerging Technologies: Safe Havens?**

You've rightly pointed out that knowledge workers in unexplored or niche fields are safer. However, it's essential to emphasize that these workers must remain vigilant by continually updating their skills. Emerging technologies offer opportunities for growth, requiring human ingenuity to develop and refine. Staying ahead of the AI curve involves seeking out new knowledge and expertise.

#### **The Role of Creativity and Human Touch**

AI excels at pattern recognition and large-scale data processing, but there are areas where human creativity, emotional intelligence, and nuanced decision-making are irreplaceable. These uniquely human traits will continue to play a critical role in the workforce. Emphasizing this can add depth to your argument about the future of work.

#### **A Call to Action**

To make this discussion more actionable, I encourage readers to assess their careers and identify areas where they can upskill or pivot towards more AI-resistant roles. Whether it's by embracing creativity, honing expertise in niche fields, or learning how to collaborate with AI, there are steps everyone can take to ensure they remain valuable in the AI era.
