### Narcissists Analysis.

Last night, From Dr.Sam Valkin, I heard about the term dismissive avoidant narcissist. I myself consider myself to be an avoidant but not a narcissist. So, I thought of looking into it further. Because I don’t want to become the despicable narcissist (The selfish, loveless one).

Let’s see the traits of an avoidant, they protect themselves by avoiding. Avoiding is their coping mechanism. Avoidants can be manipulative, selfish, hateful but never non-empathetic. What that means is their love for others is not zero. They can even be manipulative/selfish/hateful to protect everyone from the trauma not just themselves. They’re introverted, but they have love with themselves.

But, narcissists are someone without empathy. Zero empathy for others.
