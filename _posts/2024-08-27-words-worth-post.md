### Words words words

Look at the words, BUZZ words, are they really useful? They are just created for someone else’s gain. For example, look at the word “shadow-work” what does that even mean? Why do they keep it less accessible for the general public? Isn’t it a form of capitalism? Why can’t they call as a “non-showable negative traits”? 

Now, adjectives, I love them, and when they are formed by combining verbs like “lovely, hateful, “ etc. They are very clear. Why can’t people be open and be accessible for all? Whoever is willing can access their words.
