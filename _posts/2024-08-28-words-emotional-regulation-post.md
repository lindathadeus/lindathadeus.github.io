### Words: Emotional Regulation

Recently, I got to know about the word, emotional regulation. I was confused. The capitalist inventors will keep on creating words for selling something I thought. But, it’s really mentioned in multiple trauma related videos and contents.

I really wanted to regulate my emotions but I didn’t know how. Then, one day I saw that video on the LinkedIn platform. In that video they said that they would like to think of emotional regulation as “You are hurting but I am not, it’s not my time for the hurt, I am not affected by the event physically so I don’t want to let it affect my emotions.”

Such simple words na?
