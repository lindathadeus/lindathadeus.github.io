### Actors in an Abuse

Trauma bonds involve various roles that perpetuate the cycle of abuse:

1. **Victim**: The emotionally or physically harmed individual who feels trapped.
2. **Abuser/Perpetrator**: The one who exerts control, often using manipulation and harm.
3. **Enabler**: Supports or reinforces the abusive behavior, usually unintentionally.
4. **Bystander**: Aware of the abuse but remains passive or uninvolved, they may be empathetic or apathetic
5. **Rescuer/Savior**: Tries to help the victim but can inadvertently enable dependency.

These roles, whether active or passive, contribute to the complex dynamics of trauma bonds, making it crucial to recognize and address them for healing.

### Wow, empaths are totally useless unless theyâ€™re doing something about their emotions, right?
