### Storm of Negative Thoughts again.
Recently, I posted about the reason for having a storm of negative thoughts and again I got a storm. And, this time too my stomach was not at ease.
I had eaten too much peanut butter that day, from the morning till the night, we Indians are not careful with the quantity.

This time, I couldn't even sleep well as I was having racing heart and I started getting the negative thoughts. After a while, I slept, but I was not fully rested and that shows that we all have to be careful with out food.

That also implies that, our emotions are mainly from our stomach? stomach bacteria?

### Guess, we should really be cautious about what we eat.
