### Why should we not take words as the primary mode of communication?

I have started to dislike using words as our primary mode of communication. Because, 
1. firstly not a lot of good intention words are being spoken, 
2. even if they are spoken with good intention the choice of words if not pleasing to hear, could mess up the receiver and sender relationships,
3. The words need to be learned so can be exploited by the people with practice, older people have an edge than the younger ones and the newborns totally can’t even use it, so not really a fair field.
4. Not inclusive of animals, plants and other coliving beings.
5. Narcissists are despicable.

Now, what communication does a newborn understand? I think, action, physical touch feel, facial expressions and emotions. Even other animals can understand physical touch, facial expressions and emotions. So, why don’t we just use it more often? 

In fact, Priscilla Dunstan, an expert in baby language, had found out few sounds used by babies under 3 months and helped us to include their vocabulary too in our words.

Also, if we want to reduce the communication with the strangers, we can physically reduce the distance, actions alongside the words.

### So, isn’t it better to reduce the words and use the other sensory inputs like facial expressions and even body languages along with the words?
