### Why Should We Not Take Words as the Primary Mode of Communication?

I have started to dislike using words as our primary mode of communication because: 
1. Firstly, not a lot of well-intentioned words are being spoken.
2. Even if they are spoken with good intention, the choice of words, if not pleasing to hear, could mess up the receiver and sender relationships.
3. The words need to be learned, so they can be exploited by people with more practice. Older people have an edge over younger ones, and newborns totally can’t use them, so it’s not really a fair field.
4. Words are not inclusive of animals, plants, and other co-living beings.
5. Narcissists are despicable.

Now, what communication does a newborn understand? I think it’s action, physical touch, facial expressions, and emotions. Even other animals can understand physical touch, facial expressions, and emotions. So, why don’t we just use these more often?

In fact, Priscilla Dunstan, an expert in baby language, discovered a few sounds used by babies under 3 months old and helped us to include their "vocabulary" in our words.

Also, if we want to reduce communication with strangers, we can physically reduce the distance and use actions alongside words.

### So, Isn’t It Better to Reduce Words and Use Other Sensory Inputs Like Facial Expressions and Body Language Along with Words?
