# What happened?: My Pathetic Childhood 

Growing up, I faced significant emotional challenges that deeply affected my self-esteem. My skin problems, emotional stress at home, and feelings of guilt weighed on me for years. But there came a turning point, and this is how I began to overcome it.

## Dependence and Emotional Boundaries

As a teenager, I relied heavily on my sick mother—not just for support, but to shamelessly hide my despicable self from the world. This led to **"pathetic dependence on my sick mom"**, where I escaped the realities of life. I had low self-esteem, worsened by family stress and my insecurities about my skin. **"I wasn’t emotionally secure, and I used my sick mom to hide from the cruel world, which left me feeling guilty."**

## Guilt and Trespassing

I carried immense guilt. **"I felt guilty for using my mom, was punished unnecessarily for others' mistakes, and trespassed upon by those around me."** Lacking boundaries, I allowed emotional chaos to take over. It wasn’t until I left home that I finally found relief.

## Finding Freedom and Anonymity

**"One day, I left that place for a better life."** The emotional weight lifted when I went away to school. **"Being a student protected me by providing anonymity."** This new environment, away from the constant stress, allowed me to heal. I was able to focus on myself without being overwhelmed.

## Lessons in Boundaries and Self-Worth

Looking back, I see how important emotional distance was in rebuilding my self-esteem. Setting boundaries was key to finding balance. Emotional freedom is about recognizing when to step away from toxic environments and reclaiming control over your life.
