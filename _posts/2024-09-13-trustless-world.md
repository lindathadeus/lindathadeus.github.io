## We live in a jealous society?

Our trust on others has never been this low, based on my observation. I remember the days, when we didn’t have smartphones, social media, but, the neighbours were not really too jealous of us and we were not too jealous of them either. We were not too much richer or too much poorer than our neighbours. We were not all working in the same domain, like my parents were both bureaucrats and our neighbours were once bureaucrat and a home maker, another time they were engineers, and some other time they were teachers. Of course, people made varied amounts of money, a little bit jealousy was there, but nothing of the current scale. 

## We live in a competitive society?

We are all living in competition with others all of the times. I remember the days when we did not have this much rigorous competition when our neighbour had a reward. 

## We live in a trust less society?

We do not trust our neighbours anymore. TBH I stopped trusting my dad or sister even. There’s no love for others anymore. Of course, I have my reasons. 

## Does Abundance creates Isolation?

Abundance creates isolation, trust less ness, independence. I read an article about Meadow voles and prairies voles, and their relationships and lifestyles based on their environment. Basically it said that the voles that were in Meadows were sexually promiscuous while their prairies counterparts weren’t. In Meadows, where they would find plenty of food, the voles didn’t care about their relationships, their younger ones, but in prairies, the voles had to gather food and seek food and food wasn’t abundant but scarce, so the male voles were monogamous and even helped the female voles to raise their offsprings, and it was a necessity that they remain monogamous for the survival of their offsprings unlike the meadows voles, where even young voles could easily afford to find food themselves easily. Also, the meadow voles were not very close with each other or socially bonding a lot as much as their prairies counterparts. 

So, abundance removes the necessity of support from the others, scarcity connects people together on the basis of needs. 

As world moves forward we will be only abundant in all areas making us all independent of each other and totally trust less. And when there is jealousy and other negative traits then average people lose their trustworthiness. 

## How to navigate a trust less society?

We need to use the principles of blockchain technology here. The blockchain technology is used for transacting without a central trust system. They use a special network where each node has to verify their identity, keep track of transactions and then commit their transactions or contracts. Same way, we could also, verify ourselves, keep track of our commitments and other’s commitments and then enforce our legal agreements to the other person.
