The openAI has released a reasoning AI that can solve Marhematical problems. I asked it to count the no. of Rs in the strawberry and it responded correctly.
People also say that it is solving JEE questions. 

That's amazing. 

Let's try to use this AI as our tutor for finally learning DSA Fundamentals.
