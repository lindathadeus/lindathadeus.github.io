### How to run a LLM in a laptop?

{% highlight python %}
Step 1: Get a laptop with >16 GB RAM and core i7 processor (GPU too is good, but I did not use it, It took 800% from cpu, 10% from Memory 4GB, for a HelloWorld)
Step 2: Get Permission to LLAMA LLM usage from meta (Waiting Time 24 - 48 Hours, frankly unnecessary)
Step 3: Install HuggingFace-hub
Step 4: Download any LLAMA model variant from HF using huggingface-cli (7B)
Step 5: Install ctransformers
Step 6: Run the script (that you create) that opens the downloaded LLM file and use prompts on it (Check any HF LLAMA model for this)
{% endhighlight %}
