### **1\. Executive Summary**

**Purpose**: The survey of existing solutions in LLM is conducted to know the structure of each solution in terms of cost, data, primary user of the solution, i.e. the environmental cost, hardware cost, human-power cost, input data, output data, input’s parameters like size, human-made or ai-generated, output parameters like quality, quality parameters like likeability by the readers, function on the likeability by the readers like how many readers liked how much, etc. It also defines various words used in the LLM, demystifying the meaning for the readers.  
**Scope**: We will be covering the major parameters of different solutions at a high level. We will also do implementations for some of them.  
**Key Findings**: The average user of LLM is an API/Cloud LLM user, for truly enjoying the LLM technology, one has to build LLMs from scratch and for best of the both worlds, one can opt for Hybrid ones.

### **2\. Introduction**

**Background**: Short description of the technology landscape and why this survey is relevant.

  Everything is a consequence of prior actions. LLMs emerged as a response to the high consumption of cloud computing resources and the exponential growth of unstructured data generated by users through platforms like social media and internet blogs. Initially, large amounts of unstructured data were held by internet companies, necessitating insights to benefit users directly.

Some companies reportedly analyzed user data without consent, raising concerns about privacy and transparency. As a result, the need for consent and privacy protection became paramount. Companies relying on advertisements also had to understand user behavior to avoid alienating their audience. This led to the creation of intelligent systems that could collect, monitor, inspect, predict, and even generate data. Generative AI arose as a natural consequence of these developments. But, how would a common person use this AI effectively? How would it benefit them? What could happen if not?  
    
**Problem Statement**: The problem with this is, there is too much data but not much awareness about the usage of generative AI LLM tools.

**Objectives**: What the paper aims to achieve is, to compare, evaluate, or identify trends in solutions, and also to structure the solutions.

### **3\. Methodology**

**Research Approach**: 

We believe that the correct way to learn a solution is to use it. So over a period of time. We used the different solutions and we gathered some interesting insights and found some methods were easier for some set of users than the others.

**Evaluation Criteria**: Key factors used to compare solutions are cost, ease of use.

### **4\. Overview of Existing Solutions**

**Solution Categories**: As per our perspective and our research on it so far, there are 3 types of LLMs available for use. The first one is the “Cloud-based” or “Hosted” LLM. The LLM could be hosted anywhere in the open internet, or closed. The existing ideas of private cloud, public cloud, on-premises cloud, apply here too. The Hugging face comes as the public cloud based on but it is built on top of open LLMs unlike OpenAI’s GPT that is based on closed dataset LLM GPT3 and above. They typically use API as the connection. The next one is building one from scratch and making it to our taste. The other solution is making a hybrid one. Take one existing LLM and finetune with our data. For this we would use a foundational LLM and give our custom data and interacting guidelines. So, There are 3 solutions available, the first one is API based existing LLM, the next one is Home-made LLM, and the third one is Hybrid LLM.   
    
**Key Players/Technologies**: OpenAI ChatGPT, a very popular Chat-tuned LLM, LLAMA LLMs \- a popular open distribution LLM but not open weight, Microsoft Phi LLM \- a popular smaller LLM.

### **5\. Comparative Analysis**

**API Based LLMs**:  
  * Strengths  
  * Weaknesses  
  * Unique Features  

API based LLM: The first solution is the API based LLM. The most popular one amongst them is the ChatGPT by OpenAI. We would like to think of it as a Mainframe Supercomputer, where we have keyboard and dumb screens and our interaction is through these fancy wires called APIs. Now, we also have a voice mode, in future, we may also have a video mode and so on. Of-course there are different tiers where one can access these modes like, just using chat interface i.e. ChatGPT and create GPTs on top of them in their GPT store or through web services or through CLIs that would anyway have to contact these REST APIs. For the purpose of understanding these API based LLM, we created a GPT in 2 hours. Below is the GPT. So, this is the most accessible way for creating custom LLMs for our use. But, the drawbacks are obvious, we need to follow the RULES, specifically the rules given and managed by OpenAI.

  Eg GPT : Please check the appendix

**Home-made LLMs**:  
Home-made LLM: These LLMs are purely made by the users from their local machine at home or anywhere they like. But, this requires the users to be technical, they have to have knowledge of LLMs, Python and even Linux for some cases where they use Linux developer setup. We would like to think of these LLMs as truly open and purposeful LLMs. Much like, when the internet technology opened the gate-keeped knowledge and gave to the world, but it also gave multiplication over the existing issues and made it easy for the users to fall prey to DISTRACTION if there was not a PURPOSE. But, this is the best use of an LLM. Because the users generate data and they know the pattern or the world view with which they generated the data, it would be easier to them than the middle man. So, this is less environmentally bothersome too. And, so, in our perspective, we think this as the TRUE by-product of this AI revolution if it were. But this method is not very accessible to the common users and more accessible to the Developers. So, the developers should make use of this. As part of understanding this type, we created an LLM, kinda, using the existing framework like pytorch and used a custom dataset.

**Hybrid LLMs**:  
Hybrid LLM: This is the best of both worlds. This can be achieved easily with lesser time too unlike the “PURPOSEFUL LLMs” above. We downloaded the existing LLM from Hugging Face and did our prompting (and finetuning in progress) on that. This is also less accessible to common person and more suited for software engineers. As part of this survey, we downloaded a smaller LLM from Microsoft Phi Series and tried to work with that.

If the user seems ready to let go or wishes to end the conversation, the Emotions Stabilizer will respect this, encouraging closure in a supportive, empowering tone. For simplicity, the Emotions Stabilizer will focus as only positive and negative, and group all emotions under this with an intensity"}
