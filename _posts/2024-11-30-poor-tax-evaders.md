**Are taxes only for salaried employees?**
I recently saw a post in X about some food truck guy who makes 6L per month with zero taxes. That means, he is making about 72L per year. The important part is he doesn’t pay taxes on anything.

The Government of India asks the salaried employees to pay taxes when their salary cross 5LPA. But the government doesn’t tax the farmer even if they make 5000 Crores a year. The same holds for unregulated and unregistered business owners too.

House owners too don’t reveal the income fully. Small and Medium businesses don’t either. The house-helps and the cooks who work independently don’t pay tax too.

Even the Freelancers include the income to their mom and dad instead of their names for the bills.

It seems that the salaried ones are the only ones to be cursed to be taxed.
