**Are Indian innovations exploitative of the poor?**
Recently, everyone has been bitching about Indian QCommerce Startups. This is not to say that Qcomm companies are flawless. Every company has their strengths and weaknesses.

When we look at the e-commerce companies, they too are taking advantage of the consumers, sellers. When we look at the smaller shops, they too are taking advantage of their sub ordinate ones.

Of course, the qcomm companies are capitalising on the unemployed youths of India. That’s what capitalists do. They are for profit. But, they are capitalising on the individuals, who would otherwise be exploited by their parents, partners or other family members for taking out their own frustration, because who would tolerate an unemployed adult, especially when it is a Man (Sad side effects of patriarchy, Truly).

Every company is exploiting, but at least, this way, some people are getting paid  around 20k per month.

QComm Companies are exploiting but who isn’t?
