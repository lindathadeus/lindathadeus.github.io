Notably, a customer recently reported that the startup process of a database server always failed on the first attempt but ran successfully on the second. We analyzed the vmcore, probed the tracing infrastructure, and discovered that I/O was too slow due to disk overutilization. We then recommended tuning the Azure hypervisor settings. In another instance, we worked on a bug where the customerâ€™s server experienced severe network performance bottlenecks. We discovered that the issue occurred whenever the lab system was running a system backup. Further investigation revealed that the problem was due to an outdated hypervisor Ethernet driver. We identified these issues using system logs and by debugging kernel packages.","highlights":["Customer Bugs","code debugging","Oncall","Linux Systems engineering"]},{"name":"Broadcom (Brocade)","position":"R&D Engineer 3","url":"https://broadcom.com","startDate":"2021-11-01","endDate":"2023-05-31","summary":"PPC 32 bit Watchdog Device Driver Debugging and Maintenance, IOCTLs, ISR, C programming, BASH scripting.
