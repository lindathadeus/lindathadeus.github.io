Their GDP is high, middle class is strong, and they have no wars.</p> <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong>: Absolutely.

It’s efficiently governed, though it does face challenges like a high cost of living and wealth disparity.</p> <p><strong>User</strong>: What are some other strong middle-class countries?</p> <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong>: Germany, Canada, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, Finland, Austria, Belgium, and New Zealand all have strong middle classes and relatively low income inequality.</p> <p><strong>User</strong>: So, can you suggest some countries in Asia and Africa where I can travel cheaply but still experience a strong middle class?</p> <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong>: In Asia, consider Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam. In Africa, Morocco, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt are great options.
