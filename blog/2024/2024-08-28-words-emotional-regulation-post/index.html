I was confused. The capitalist inventors will keep on creating words for selling something I thought. But, it’s really mentioned in multiple trauma related videos and contents.</p> <p>I really wanted to regulate my emotions but I didn’t know how. Then, one day I saw that video on the LinkedIn platform. In that video they said that they would like to think of emotional regulation as “You are hurting but I am not, it’s not my time for the hurt, I am not affected by the event physically so I don’t want to let it affect my emotions”</p> <h2 id="such-simple-words-na">Such simple words na?</h2> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.</p> </body></html>
