No, actually, I am going to rant about how social media and AI are bothering me.</p> <p>Disclaimer: Read this at your own risk. This might just be a human hallucination amplified by the use of AI.</p> <p>Ever since the dawn of talking, humans have been social because being social through talking helped us to share knowledge about resources, work together and thrive. Some talked and did good things and some did selfish things. Talking was a very good emotion reliever. But then, social media came and ruined it for all.</p> <p>I don’t have to leave my home to talk with my friends. I can even talk to strangers and potentially dangerous people. Not that the other internet apps like quick commerce ones aren’t convenient. In fact, I would rather order easily online “at the press of a button”, than going through the hassle of negotiating, buying stuff from a fellow tricky seller who judges based on my language, economic status, looks, and what not before selling me that bag of apples.</p> <p>Information sharing online isn’t new. Web 1.0 started it. Also, online chatting had been around for decades now. But, we were not (all) sitting at the computer tables all day, chatting and expressing ourselves and consuming others’ emotions and thoughts and feelings, like we do with our smartphones today.</p> <p>The accessibility to smartphones with social media apps have amplified in the past few years and none not uses it. I see almost all people use it when I don’t use it.</p> <p><strong>Attention is all we have</strong></p> <p>My problem with the smartphone is it’s hijacking my time, attention, emotions and willpower all at once. Smartphones with the social media when I should be cooking, show me the horrors happening at Gaza, steal my anger and make me put an angry emoji while making me believe that I had helped Gazans, Palestines somehow. Isn’t it foolishness? Then, after that cooking time passes I rely on another quick food delivery service which is in the same smartphone to deliver me food. Due to overuse of smartphone, the battery spoils and I then immediately see an advertisement for a renowned smartphone brand.</p> <p>In one shot, the smartphones with the apps (capitalists) have taken my phone private details like battery data, my time, money and my emotions as well. I could have used that anger to finish that long shelved project. But, I didn’t. I could have made some healthier food for myself. But I didn’t do it either. I could just replaced my battery but I didn’t. All I was focused on was that post that was probably created by a “fringe” group and possibly AI faked too, to shake the emotional stability of the people.</p> <p>It’s even worse for social media creators, because they rely on it for income.</p> <p>Our time is not spent wisely, our emotions, attention and even thoughts are in danger of getting manipulated by strangers, when we use social media.</p> <p>Now, coming to AI, ever since AI, the “greatest yes man of all time” ever, had come, our views have become more and more narrow, isolated, because we have a “2000₹ per month” AI that said yes, we must be right, we are right, we are astrologers, we can predict future, we can also analyse the past, we can read minds, they thought THAT, they’re wrong but I am not, I am not the narcissist and what not.</p> <p>I don’t think anyone wants to carry the emotional load of others. I also think not all our emotions from social media are true, because social media doesn’t discriminate and lets everyone even the selfish ones express their emotions, and some could have been manufactured and put on purpose.</p> <p>The AI as a generic talking tool is better used after people have become adults, after knowing all the intricacies of talking, social engineering, hallucinations. The scary part is, the AI gets trained on our Hallucinations, spread our hallucinations.</p> <p>I’m really grateful for Social Media and AI because it’s how I am in my current job. But, We need to have some kind of gatekeeping. We need our own social media platform and own AI.</p> <p>Basically, instead of becoming a user on a social media platform, we could create our own social media platform. Creators would really benefit from their own social platforms and the gatekeeper AI. They could own their content, paid subscribers. AI could feed off the social media content.</p> <p>Uff, I feel lighter already.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Let me know your thoughts in the comments below!</p>]]></content><author><name>Linda Joe Thadeus</name></author><category term="justice-for-salaried-class"/><category term="world"/><category term="grace"/><category term="general"/><category term="justice-for-salaried-class"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[RANT: Truth behind Social Media and AI]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">my_ipaddrshow</title><link href="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2025/app-dev/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="my_ipaddrshow"/><published>2025-04-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2025/app-dev</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2025/app-dev/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="talk-is-cheap-show-me-the-code-1---my_ipaddrshow"><strong>Talk is CHEAP, show me the CODE #1 - my_ipaddrshow</strong></h3> <p>In this post, let us build a linux command named my_ipaddrshow.</p> <h4 id="motivation"><strong>Motivation</strong></h4> <p>My kid is in summer vacation now and she copies me a lot and has now started using one of my laptops (for playing games). As the laptop has a lot of restriction (because of her paranoid parents), she often resorts to pester me to install stuff. And I have to go to her laptop and do the stuff. I sometimes want to ssh connect to her laptop but she would not know the ip address, so, I thought of creating a command to help her.</p> <p>The existing command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ip addr show</code> is TOO MUCH for smallerkids/laymen.

And, I usually have an active Brain and it becomes hyper active when I get sick (because, of course, the unused energy of my body is there for my brain to consume). So, it generated these below ideas for our upcoming Hackathon way later in the year, during November.</p> <p><strong>1-step Courteous UDP</strong> This is a protocol enhancement like we need to add just 1 level of courtesy to the UDP without going down the rabbit hole of courtesy or niceness. UDP is my favourite type of layer 4 protocol, it just gives out information directly without any expectation for niceness and it doesn’t care to be nice, but it might be less useful for few cases and so, thought of adding one step of niceness to it.</p> <p><strong>LFS for Sony</strong> This is to build LFS project for my Sony Laptop, may go till distro.</p> <p><strong>The Punchline Mentor AI for Spirituality</strong> There are plenty of AI out there for this, but this is purely for self educational purposes only and maybe to use it to showcase at work ;). This is much closer to my heart.

I am an ardent user of ChatGPT. I used to be a premium user. But, as I got another competitor LLM (though I hate it) through our company, I stopped using the ChatGPT premium subscription .</p> <p>But, ChatGPT is the best LLM available right now. It is very much like ourselves but only as our own personal assistant, who can do most of our average knowledge tasks, available 24x7, and understand us the best with all our conversational history as another source of data, ChatGPT is unstoppable. Could you imagine yourself as your assistant? How easy life would be if our assistant is us? An intelligent-being putting our values first and prioritises us. We are not there quite yet, we will be there soon.</p> <p>Now, suddenly, a wave happened, as big as a TSUNAMI, in the name of DEEPSEEK. It crashed around 830 billion dollars from the American Stock Exchange. Deepseek family of LLMs which is a Chinese product has shaken the AI field and rightly so. AI Industry is the current hot field. It’s where the action is happening and will happen for a long time. But, just one problem. LLM Training took 5 Billions to make something as amazing as ChatGPT o3. Deepseek changed it by getting trained in 5 Millions (actually 6, but let’s keep 5 for simplicity), that’s around 1/1000 of 5 Billions. That’s a big innovation. Deepseek has shown that even above average LLMs don’t have to be too costly. Then, imagine the below average ones, or, the low efficient open ones (cough-cough-LLAMA), who would use them.</p> <p>Now, let’s look at the ones that have lost their place to DEEPSEEK. It’s not OpenAI. They are for profit and most importantly, they’re closed source. They had become for-profit and as true capitalists they will find exploitative ways to stay profit. The current real losers, are the open weight ones like LLAMA. They championed being open source, while just being open weight. They were the flag bearers for open LLMs, AI teams from Meta came to India for canvassing too. Open weight ones cannot afford to be very costly. But LLAMA was. So, DEEPSEEK has dethroned LLAMA right now and taken its rightful top place in the open weight LLMs space.</p> <p>So, now all the players are trying to bring the training cost down. That’s good for the average user of LLM. But, the demand for hardware for training will be there. They will just add more features on the existing LLMs and the make the training cost worth it.</p> <p>The current wave is to make an ethical and moral AI. And India, the birthplace of morals and ethics, with her rich literature on the subject, can actually surf the current wave.</p> <p>Could India finally become a Global Spiritual Leader?</p> <hr/> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Let me know your thoughts in the comments below!</p>]]></content><author><name>Linda Joe Thadeus</name></author><category term="llm"/><category term="llm"/><category term="general"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Deepseek Wave: Who’s under risk actually?

We are constantly using social media, essentially consuming content made by people around the world. IMHO, We are over-consuming this unflitered, unprocessed, unhealthy, potentially dangerous content. “Too much of anything is GOOD for NOTHING”. With that in mind, I asked chatGPT to design a digital content digesting system, based on our human digestive system. Below is what it came up with.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="ais-response">AI’s response:</h3> <p>Here’s a <strong>Digital Content Digestive System</strong>, inspired by the human digestive system. This framework processes digital content, extracts its essence, and eliminates toxicity while nurturing intellectual and emotional well-being.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="1-the-mouth-entry-point"><strong>1. The Mouth: Entry Point</strong></h3> <p>The mouth represents how digital content enters our system.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Taste Buds:</strong> These are our instincts or initial reactions to content. We instinctively “taste” content, deciding whether it’s sweet (uplifting), sour (controversial), salty (engaging but trivial), or bitter (toxic).</li> <li><strong>Chewing:</strong> The act of skimming or engaging lightly with content before fully “digesting” it. Chewing allows us to break down complex information into smaller, understandable bites.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h3 id="2-the-esophagus-the-filter-pathway"><strong>2. The Esophagus: The Filter Pathway</strong></h3> <p>The esophagus is the pipeline that transfers content to the deeper layers of our consciousness.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Sphincter as a Filter:</strong> A gatekeeper decides what content moves forward and what gets rejected. Algorithms or personal filters act like the lower esophageal sphincter, blocking junk or harmful content from reaching the next stage.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h3 id="3-the-stomach-breakdown-and-absorption"><strong>3. The Stomach: Breakdown and Absorption</strong></h3> <p>The stomach represents the heavy processing center where content is broken down.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Digestive Juices (Critical Thinking):</strong> Enzymes like curiosity, skepticism, and emotional intelligence dissolve content into core ideas or messages.</li> <li><strong>Churning:</strong> A mental process of mixing and analyzing content—debating internally, connecting ideas, or seeking clarity.</li> <li><strong>Acidic Reactions:</strong> Toxic content that slips through can cause mental “indigestion,” like stress or anxiety, which must be neutralized.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h3 id="4-the-small-intestine-absorption-of-value"><strong>4. The Small Intestine: Absorption of Value</strong></h3> <p>Here, the useful nutrients of digital content are absorbed into our intellectual and emotional bloodstream.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Villi (Cognitive Filters):</strong> These tiny, finger-like projections represent mental frameworks that decide what knowledge, insights, or inspiration are worth keeping.</li> <li><strong>Selective Absorption:</strong> Not all content nutrients are equally absorbed. What aligns with our goals or values is prioritized, while the rest passes through.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h3 id="5-the-liver-detoxification"><strong>5. The Liver: Detoxification</strong></h3> <p>The liver is the content detox center, removing harmful elements and neutralizing toxic influences.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Emotional Processing:</strong> Reflecting on and re-evaluating upsetting or harmful content ensures it doesn’t poison our long-term mindset.</li> <li><strong>Storage for Reuse:</strong> The liver stores valuable insights temporarily, much like saving articles or bookmarking useful ideas for later retrieval.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h3 id="6-the-large-intestine-consolidation-and-elimination"><strong>6. The Large Intestine: Consolidation and Elimination</strong></h3> <p>The large intestine processes remaining content, extracting final bits of value and consolidating waste.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Final Extraction (Reflection):</strong> Any leftover meaning, patterns, or lessons are extracted here before eliminating irrelevant or harmful ideas.</li> <li><strong>Digital Elimination (Content Waste):</strong> Harmful or unnecessary content is expelled from the system—unfollowed, blocked, or forgotten.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h3 id="7-the-rectum-output-to-the-world"><strong>7. The Rectum: Output to the World</strong></h3> <p>The rectum symbolizes how we share or act upon digested content.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Actions and Creations:</strong> The essence of consumed content manifests as personal growth, informed decisions, or creative output.</li> <li><strong>Feedback Loop:</strong> Our actions influence future content consumption, shaping our “diet” based on what we “digest” and share.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h3 id="8-gut-microbiome-mental-ecosystem"><strong>8. Gut Microbiome: Mental Ecosystem</strong></h3> <p>The microbiome represents our internal mental state and habits that influence how we process content.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Good Bacteria (Positive Habits):</strong> Practices like mindfulness, gratitude, and learning foster resilience and help digest challenging ideas.</li> <li><strong>Bad Bacteria (Addictive Habits):</strong> Overconsumption, doomscrolling, or engaging with toxic communities disrupt the balance, leading to mental fatigue or anxiety.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h3 id="9-the-nervous-system-feedback-and-regulation"><strong>9. The Nervous System: Feedback and Regulation</strong></h3> <p>The brain-gut connection ensures the system operates effectively.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Signals (Alerts &amp; Warnings):</strong> Emotional cues like stress or joy guide us toward better choices. A peaceful mind reflects a balanced digital diet.</li> <li><strong>Regulation:</strong> Just like the digestive system adjusts enzyme levels, our cognitive system can recalibrate—taking breaks, adjusting exposure, or seeking inspiration.</li> </ul> <hr/> <p>This digital digestion system ensures that content is consumed thoughtfully, processed effectively, and that toxins are eliminated, leaving behind only value and insight to nurture the mind.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Should we create this system with each component being a separate AI Agent and the goal defined as per the above design? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below. Together, we can navigate this evolving landscape and find our place in the future.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="AI"/><category term="graceful-bonding"/><category term="AI-conversations"/><category term="palatable-digital-systems"/><category term="emerging technologies"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Worthy Words #3: Shadow Work</title><link href="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/shadow-work/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Worthy Words #3: Shadow Work"/><published>2024-12-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/shadow-work</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/shadow-work/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Worthy Words #3: Shadow Work</strong></p> <p>In this post on <strong>Worthy Words</strong>, we are gonna look at Shadow Work. <strong>Worthy Words</strong> is a blog series, where we learn about seemingly worldly important words.</p> <p>This blog post covers about the word “Shadow Work”. Disclaimer: These’re all psychology terms and I am not a psychology expert, I am just a humble (read lowly), software engineer. Now, why do I believe that I could write a blog post on a word that’s not in my area of expertise? Sure, I am not a Psychology expert, but, I too have a mind, like the fellow human reader, I too have emotions and I have been fighting my emotions for more than 20 years. Fighting with emotions for 20+ years surely gives us an experience. Also, I am not going to talk about the academic psychology behind it but from the practical perspective of a software engineer who writes, debugs and analyses code for work.</p> <p>Let’s first look into the word “Shadow”. The word “Shadow” comes from Carl Jung, who equated that with our hidden and dark traits. For example, Everyone is nice at the office because of the HR rules and the watchful eyes of the fellow employees. But, not everyone is gentle, loving, caring (why should they in a competing environment? Right?) at heart. Some could be in survival mode. Some could have unresolved childhood trauma and still want vengeance. And some might be just raised that way and stay bad. On the other end, some positive traits like hugging, touching, holding others aren’t particularly acceptable by the public too, it’s bad to hug people from other gender. Everyone masks their bad traits to satisfy the HR’s condition to remain on the team.</p> <p>These traits (non-acceptable, consciously repressed for some reason) that are masked behind the outwardly same niceness, are “Shadow Traits”. Any work done on the Shadow to hopefully improve the darkness is “Shadow Work”.</p> <p>P.S. Now, why is it important for us to understand the shadow traits of a person. Actually, not for a person in a professional setting, but for someone who is entering the personal space of their desirable partner, it is very empowering to know their “Shadow Traits”. Because, if the shadow traits were luckily just hugging or something positive, then it would not hurt, but when they are negative, then, it’s bad for the desiring person. Knowing the “Shadow Traits” empower the potential partners. AI might be finetuned to understand the shadow traits of a person a bit and used alongside dating apps. Also, some say that prisoners have positive shadow too.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Let me know your thoughts in the comments below!</p>]]></content><author><name>Linda Joe Thadeus</name></author><category term="graceful-bonding"/><category term="world"/><category term="grace"/><category term="general"/><category term="worthy-words"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Worthy Words #3: Shadow Work]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Can taxes be evaded if not a salaried job?</title><link href="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/poor-tax-evaders/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Can taxes be evaded if not a salaried job?"/><published>2024-11-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-11-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/poor-tax-evaders</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/poor-tax-evaders/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Are taxes only for salaried employees?</strong> I recently saw a post in X about some food truck guy who makes 6L per month with zero taxes.

It’s big, it’s powerful, and it’s hungry. But as we’ve seen throughout history, even the mightiest can fall. Could capitalism, like the dinosaurs, be headed for extinction? Let’s explore the parallels.</p> <p><strong>Dinosaurs and Capitalism: A Striking Comparison</strong></p> <p>Dinosaurs were magnificent creatures—massive, competitive, and seemingly invincible. But their success came at a cost. They consumed vast resources, dominated ecosystems, and left little room for other species to thrive. When disaster struck, their inability to adapt led to their extinction.</p> <p>Capitalism operates in a similar way. It’s competitive, resource-intensive, and thrives on growth at all costs. But like the dinosaurs, it struggles to address the needs of smaller, less fortunate players in the system. Inequality, exploitation, and environmental destruction are byproducts of a system that prioritizes profit over people.</p> <p><strong>The Meteorite of Modern Times</strong></p> <p>What could be the “meteorite” that brings capitalism down? There are several contenders:</p> <ul> <li>Climate Change: A system that relies on endless consumption is unsustainable in a world with finite resources. The environmental crisis is a direct consequence of capitalism’s unchecked hunger.</li> <li>Inequality: Wealth concentration at the top is leaving billions behind. As this gap widens, social unrest grows, threatening the stability of capitalist economies.</li> <li>Technological Disruption: Automation and AI are displacing workers, while profits flow to corporations. Without addressing this imbalance, capitalism risks alienating the very people it depends on.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Socialism: The Cockroach of Economic Systems?</strong></p> <p>While dinosaurs perished, cockroaches survived. Why? Because they were adaptable, resourceful, and didn’t rely on domination. In this analogy, socialism represents a leaner, more equitable approach to economic organization—one that prioritizes cooperation over competition.</p> <p>Here’s why socialism could be the more sustainable option:</p> <ul> <li>Equity Over Exploitation: Socialism ensures that resources are distributed fairly, meeting basic needs like healthcare, education, and housing for all.</li> <li>Collaboration Over Competition: Instead of a cutthroat race for profits, socialism emphasizes working together for the collective good.</li> <li>Sustainability Over Growth: Unlike capitalism’s obsession with endless growth, socialism can align economic goals with environmental preservation.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Is the Fall of Capitalism Inevitable?</strong></p> <p>The fall of the dinosaurs wasn’t inevitable—it was the result of external pressures combined with their inability to adapt. Similarly, capitalism’s survival depends on its willingness to evolve. But if it continues to prioritize short-term profits over long-term sustainability, its extinction may indeed be unavoidable.</p> <p>The question is: Will we act before the meteorite strikes?</p> <p><strong>Conclusion: Time to Rethink Our Systems</strong> Capitalism has achieved incredible things, from technological breakthroughs to improved standards of living for many. But it’s also left billions behind and pushed our planet to its limits. It’s time to ask ourselves: Can we afford to let capitalism continue unchecked, or is it time to embrace a system that works for everyone?</p> <hr/> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Is capitalism a hungry dinosaur doomed to fall, or can it adapt to avoid extinction?

I also always wanted to make games. I tried creating games during my college years. I even found some tools like Microsoft XNA Framework. But still I din’t know what to do with that framework. No disrespect but If a dog finds a coconut then what can it do? I did not know how to use that tool and I did not know how to create games without that tool too. Both were necessary and I had neither, so it was just a failure. Fast-forward. Now, we have the “NEWEST &amp; HOTTEST TOOL” i.e. LLM and they have the entire internet in them. But I still did not know how to create games. So, I started to think from the perspective of scarcity, i.e. without that LLM tool, I found out that there are few basic concepts in a game.</p> <h3 id="words-in-a-game">Words in a Game</h3> <ul> <li>Game Loop</li> <li>User-input and Player Movement Mapping (User Input Handling)</li> <li>Rendering and Animation (What use a game is if there is no animation)</li> <li>Physics and Collision Detection</li> <li>Scoring and so on</li> </ul> <h3 id="words-as-input-to-llm">Words as input to LLM</h3> <p>Now that we have got the foundation of knowledge i.e. words, I had to do was to give the words to my offline internet (LLM) and got the relevant information immediately.</p> <h3 id="microsoft-xna-or-godot-or-raylib">Microsoft XNA or Godot or Raylib</h3> <p>And then, I had to use a Game Library like XNA, I used raylib, as I am now in the Linux machine. I generated code blocks for the words and connected them together, I am a software dev so it is easier for me. And, it gave me comfort like no other game.</p> <p>The important thing is I now know game development and I don’t need the tool to create. The tool just expedites my process.</p> <h3 id="ref">Ref:</h3> <p><a href="https://github.com/lindathadeus/gameyatra/tree/master/2-i-saw">github link</a> —</p> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.</p>]]></content><author><name>Linda Joe Thadeus</name></author><category term="app"/><category term="game"/><category term="app"/><category term="game"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How I finally managed to understand game development?]]></summary></entry></feed>
