Here’s a quick overview of this journey:</p> <h3 id="1-small-scale-agriculture">1. Small-Scale Agriculture</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Abundance Created:</strong> Survival skills, basic tools, and money.</li> <li><strong>Scarcity Removed:</strong> High mortality.</li> <li><strong>New Demand:</strong> Food production and human muscle power (mechanical energy).</li> </ul> <p>Early human-beings used to be hunter-gatherers, with hunter-men leaving their women and children for hunting for a longer distance and most times never returned because of some animal attack or they found some other women from the tribe. The survival rate of them were very less on an average. But, all this changed when human beings discovered AGRICULTURE. Women and children were able to manage surviving without the men. They did not have to go into the woods for GATHERING food. Even there was a reduced need for Hunting as Human-beings started DOMESTICATION of animals like sheeps, pigs, buffaloes and used them instead of HUNTING. This reduced the MORTALITY of human-beings. Agricultural practices involved using simple mechanical tools and used manual-labourers. They selectively bred animal and cultivated and nurtured digestible food-crops.</p> <h3 id="2-agricultural-revolution">2. Agricultural Revolution</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Abundance Created:</strong> Food surplus and population growth.</li> <li><strong>Scarcity Removed:</strong> Food scarcity.</li> <li><strong>New Demand:</strong> Tools and mechanical energy at scale to increase productivity.</li> </ul> <p>With the advent of Agriculture, the survival rate increased and suddenly the population exploded giving rise to all higher level problems (when compared to MORTALITY) like, WEALTH-INEQUALITY, SLAVERY, CASTEISM, RACISM. But, people who were not subject to the higher level problems faced the MORTALITY. There came a need for increased food production for feeding the ever growing population and selective people with the agricultural knowledge took advantage of the non-knowledgable using SLAVERY so as to maximize the PROFITS. Then came the GREEN REVOLUTION with the genetically modified seeds, the YIELD/PROFITS became too HIGH eradicating the need for SLAVERY. Suddenly, the human muscle energy became too less. Thus, the need for BETTER TOOLS for TRANSPORTATION of the crops from one place to another and etc.</p> <h3 id="3-industrial-revolution">3. Industrial Revolution</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Abundance Created:</strong> Machinery powered by fossil fuels.</li> <li><strong>Scarcity Removed:</strong> Labor scarcity in production.</li> <li><strong>New Demand:</strong> Inventory management, faster communication, and large-scale energy supply.</li> </ul> <p>The demand of transportation of the newly found Agricultural Revolution gave birth to HIGH YIELD Crops that would have to be PRESERVED, TRANSPORTED to far away lands, MANAGED naturally wanted a revolution in the vehicles and energy. At this time, SLAVERY was getting abolished and people’s earlier skills were nullified and essentially equalised the playing field, thus as a side-effect abolishing slavery. The steam powered railway engines moved to FOSSIL-FUEL powered HIGH-PERFORMANCE railway/ship engines that were faster to transport the finished goods from one place to another. The GOODS manufactured were too high that we had to create software in-place to manage them, talk with clients globally.</p> <h3 id="4-it-revolution">4. IT Revolution</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Abundance Created:</strong> Data and digital technologies.</li> <li><strong>Scarcity Removed:</strong> Knowledge scarcity.</li> <li><strong>New Demand:</strong> Data management, accessibility, and intelligence skills at scale.</li> </ul> <p>The demand for software to manage and communicate resulted in generation of too many digital content waiting to be consumed by people to become knowledgeable and thus creating an EQUALIZER.</p> <h3 id="5-education-revolution">5. Education Revolution</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Abundance Created:</strong> Skills and education.</li> <li><strong>Scarcity Removed:</strong> Skill scarcity.</li> <li><strong>New Demand:</strong> AI skills management/accessibility, renewable energy, and computing power at scale.</li> </ul> <p>As more people gained access to education, the Education Revolution helped eliminate skill scarcity. The global workforce became more knowledgeable, leading to a demand for AI educator at scale, renewable energy solutions, and computing power to sustain the growing technological infrastructure. AI products are the abundance created.</p> <h3 id="6-ai-revolution">6. AI Revolution</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Abundance Created:</strong> Intelligent systems and automation.</li> <li><strong>Scarcity Removed:</strong> Cognitive labor scarcity.</li> <li><strong>New Demand:</strong> Ethical AI frameworks, human-AI collaboration, sustainable energy, physical body form for AI, biological integration.</li> </ul> <p>Next is the AI Revolution, which too like the previous revolution will be an EQUALIZER of the AI products. Everyone could and would own an AI. The Ethical AI Agent would be the Leader. They would remove the previous scarcity that would be Management of AI products.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.</p>]]></content><author><name>Linda Joe Thadeus</name></author><category term="llm"/><category term="llm"/><category term="world"/><category term="general"/><category term="history"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How Humanity Evolved from Scarcity to Abundance]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to run LLM on a laptop?</title><link href="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/understanding-abi-1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to run LLM on a laptop?"/><published>2024-09-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/understanding-abi-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/understanding-abi-1/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="how-to-run-a-llm-in-a-laptop">How to run a LLM in a laptop?</h3> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="n">Step</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Get</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">laptop</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="mi">16</span> <span class="n">GB</span> <span class="n">RAM</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">core</span> <span class="n">i7</span> <span class="nf">processor </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">GPU</span> <span class="n">too</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="n">good</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">but</span> <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">did</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">use</span> <span class="n">it</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">It</span> <span class="n">took</span> <span class="mi">800</span><span class="o">%</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">cpu</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">%</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">Memory</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="n">GB</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">HelloWorld</span><span class="p">)</span>

Instead, the ABI (Application Binary Interface) plays a crucial role in facilitating the communication between the program and the operating system. In this blog post, we’ll dive into the key aspects of ABI through a practical example, a simple “Hello, World”.</p> <h3 id="step-1-writing-and-compiling-a-simple-c-program">Step 1: Writing and Compiling a Simple C Program</h3> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;"</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> hi.c
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"int main() {"</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> hi.c
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"  printf(</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2">Hello, World!</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2">);"</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> hi.c

<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"}"</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> hi.c

gcc hi.c <span class="nt">-o</span> hi
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The resulting binary is an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file, a standard format used in Linux systems. This file uses the ABI to interact with the OS when executed.</p> <h3 id="step-2-key-responsibilities-of-the-abi">Step 2: Key Responsibilities of the ABI</h3> <p>When the binary runs, the ABI ensures several key operations:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Calling Conventions</strong>: It defines how function arguments are passed—whether in registers or on the stack.</li> <li><strong>System Calls</strong>: The ABI manages the interactions between the binary and the OS, particularly how system calls are invoked.</li> <li><strong>Binary Format</strong>: The structure of the binary file, including sections like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.text</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.data</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bss</code>, is defined by the ABI.</li> <li><strong>Linking</strong>: It governs how dynamic or static linking is handled between the program and shared libraries, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libc.so</code>.</li> </ol> <h3 id="step-3-inspecting-the-binary">Step 3: Inspecting the Binary</h3> <p>You can inspect the compiled binary using tools like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readelf</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ldd</code>:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>readelf <span class="nt">-h</span> hi
<span class="nv">$ </span>ldd ./hi
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This shows the ELF header and dynamic library dependencies, respectively. For example:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffe625f0000)
libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
</code></pre></div></div> <h3 id="step-4-generating-assembly-code">Step 4: Generating Assembly Code</h3> <p>To view the assembly equivalent of the C program, you can generate the assembly code:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>gcc <span class="nt">-S</span> hi.c <span class="nt">-o</span> hi.S
<span class="nv">$ </span>file hi.S
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This outputs the assembly source code, giving you insight into the low-level instructions that are executed.</p> <h3 id="step-5-abi-compatibility">Step 5: ABI Compatibility</h3> <p>The ABI ensures compatibility across different Linux distributions, allowing binaries compiled on one system to work seamlessly on another. Here’s a checklist of what the ABI manages:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Data Types</strong>: Defines the sizes and alignment of data types like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">long</code>.</li> <li><strong>Endianness</strong>: Specifies the byte order in which data is stored.</li> <li><strong>System Calls</strong>: Governs how to request services from the kernel.</li> <li><strong>Linkage Conventions</strong>: Dictates how libraries are linked and called.</li> </ul> <h3 id="step-6-system-call-analysis">Step 6: System Call Analysis</h3> <p>Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strace</code>, we can analyze the system calls used by our simple “Hello, World!” program:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>strace ./hi
execve<span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">"./hi"</span>, <span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">"./hi"</span><span class="o">]</span>, 0x7dddeedbeef /<span class="k">*</span> 53 vars <span class="k">*</span>/<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> 0
brk<span class="o">(</span>NULL<span class="o">)</span>                               <span class="o">=</span> 0x5bbdddeedbeef

access<span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">"/etc/ld.so.preload"</span>, R_OK<span class="o">)</span>      <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nt">-1</span> ENOENT <span class="o">(</span>No such file or directory<span class="o">)</span>
openat<span class="o">(</span>AT_FDCWD, <span class="s2">"/etc/ld.so.cache"</span>, O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> 3
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The output reveals multiple system calls, even for a simple program:</p> <ul> <li><strong>execve</strong>: Executes the binary.</li> <li><strong>openat</strong>: Opens shared libraries.</li> <li><strong>write</strong>: Outputs “Hello, World!” to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stdout</code>.</li> <li><strong>exit_group</strong>: Terminates the program.</li> </ul> <h3 id="why-so-many-system-calls">Why So Many System Calls?</h3> <p>Even a basic program like this makes numerous system calls because:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Memory Management</strong>: The OS needs to allocate memory for the program.</li> <li><strong>Library Linking</strong>: The program relies on shared libraries like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libc</code>.</li> <li><strong>Resource Management</strong>: The system must handle file descriptors, memory, and potentially threading.</li> </ul> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>The ABI is essential for maintaining compatibility and ensuring that programs run correctly across different systems. Understanding how the ABI manages function calls, system interactions, and binary formats can deepen your knowledge of Linux programming and system operations. Even though a “Hello, World!” program appears simple, it triggers complex interactions behind the scenes, all managed by the ABI.</p> <hr/> <p>By exploring ABI, you gain a better understanding of how Linux systems work under the hood, making you a more effective developer.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="linux"/><category term="linux"/><category term="ABI"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we compile and execute a program in Linux, it’s not just the source code interacting with the system directly.

What if we could transform these tools into collaborative, value-driven strategies that benefit everyone? For instance, Let us look at “Mugging”. People mug others to get money from others, so that they could make their ends meet. The people who mug others are not happy to do it, the people who get mugged are so unhappy and sometimes get harmed physically too. Let us take another instance, the Indian parents are hitting their kids, why? so that they discipline their children. But, like the previous case, none is happy to do it. So, can we do it in a way that benefits everyone. Sounds Familiar? We are trying to solve this using capitalism’s principles.</p> <p>Let us look at the below steps to do it.</p> <h3 id="1-identify-the-core-objective">1. Identify the Core Objective</h3> <ul> <li>Clarify your goals: Understand the underlying need or desire.</li> <li>Assess motivations: Reflect on why you want to achieve it.</li> </ul> <p>For instance, In the case of Indian Parents hitting their kids, the end-goal of the action is nothing but, disciplining. The thing wrong here is the METHOD used for disciplining the kids.</p> <h3 id="2-understand-the-impact-of-direct-tools">2. Understand the Impact of Direct Tools</h3> <ul> <li>Evaluate consequences: Consider the legal, ethical, and social costs.</li> <li>Acknowledge harm: Recognize how others are negatively affected.</li> </ul> <p>We, millenials have ourselves faced the harmful effects of hitting kids. The direct con is the child resenting the parent and the sibling for not helping them. The indirect con is the sibling resenting both themselves for not helping their sibling and the parent for the emotional hurt for making them witness the punishment.</p> <h3 id="3-reframe-the-objective-into-a-value-proposition">3. Reframe the Objective into a Value Proposition</h3> <ul> <li>Shift perspective: How can you achieve your goal while adding value?</li> <li>Identify mutual benefits: Find what others need and how you can help.</li> </ul> <p>Now, all we need to do is the change the METHOD deployed in the situation to achieve the goal. Let us take an example from my childhood when I was thrashed. I was not thrashed much by parents when compared to my sibling. I only have data only for my case, so let us focus on that. When I got thrashed, it was because I was overplaying with my neighbours that I was causing trouble to my neighbours. So, instead of my mom (She had only hit me once, the major punishments were conducted by my dad on my sibling - twin) hitting me, she could have hit me and added some LOVE component to it, which she did, I loved my Mom. Let us take another scenario, where I was punished by my Head Mistress for not tying my hair properly. She punished me for a long time that would have worked simple cases, but for me it would not because, I had a stressful home. Instead, she should have UNDERSTOOD (EMPATHY) my problems and informed by parents. So, eventually, after some time, she informed my Mom and my mom tied my hair properly. So, that is how, it has to be done.</p> <h3 id="4-develop-a-mutually-beneficial-strategy">4. Develop a Mutually Beneficial Strategy</h3> <ul> <li>Innovate solutions: Meet your goals through products or services people want.</li> <li>Leverage skills: Use your talents and resources to provide value.</li> </ul> <p>In the story of me getting punished by my HM (Head Mistress), I was eventually understood, by them contacting my Mom. But, it was sorta late. Because, this was a missed opportunity to capitalise on the problem early on. They could have informed my mom early on and thereby making me a bit less resentful of them and they might have had an ALUMNA, who would be GLAD to reach out to them for the future endeavours. But, they had a lot of people, and I am no longer hateful of them because of time and I am UNDERSTANDING their pains too. I still don’t want to collaborate with them ever, because of the way, they ill-treated my SICK Mom.</p> <h3 id="5-establish-ethical-and-transparent-practices">5. Establish Ethical and Transparent Practices</h3> <ul> <li>Set clear guidelines: Ensure legal and ethical methods.</li> <li>Promote fairness: Build trust through equitable actions.</li> </ul> <p>Anyway, we could have avoided this DRAMA, if we had just followed a set of rules for taking care of students with issues. Like, if I am opening a school, and I see a child not taking care of themselves, even when I had pointed out, I would directly empower them to do it.</p> <p>By following this framework, you transform direct, often harmful tools into ethical strategies that foster collaboration and mutual success, benefiting both you and society.</p> <p><strong>Keywords</strong>: ethical business, collaboration, value-driven strategies, mutual success</p> <hr/> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.</p>]]></content><author><name>Linda Joe Thadeus</name></author><category term="personal"/><category term="personal"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How I transitioned from surviving to living?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to transition from surviving to living?</title><link href="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/surviving-living/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to transition from surviving to living?"/><published>2024-09-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/surviving-living</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/surviving-living/"><![CDATA[<p>In life and business, direct tools like coercion or force can lead to short-term gains but cause long-term harm.

What if we could transform these tools into strategies that benefit everyone? Let’s take a familiar example: Indian parents hitting their kids to discipline them. Neither the parent nor the child is happy, and the long-term emotional harm outweighs the short-term behavior correction. The same applies in business—direct force rarely builds lasting success. Instead, we can use capitalism’s principles to create value-driven strategies that achieve goals while fostering positive relationships.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to navigate the trust less world?</title><link href="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/trustless-world/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to navigate the trust less world?"/><published>2024-09-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/trustless-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/trustless-world/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="we-live-in-a-jealous-society">We live in a jealous society?</h2> <p>Our trust on others has never been this low, based on my observation. I remember the days, when we didn’t have smartphones, social media, but, the neighbours were not really too jealous of us and we were not too jealous of them either. We were not too much richer or too much poorer than our neighbours. We were not all working in the same domain, like my parents were both bureaucrats and our neighbours were once bureaucrat and a home maker, another time they were engineers, and some other time they were teachers. Of course, people made varied amounts of money, a little bit jealousy was there, but nothing of the current scale.</p> <h2 id="we-live-in-a-competitive-society">We live in a competitive society?</h2> <p>We are all living in competition with others all of the times. I remember the days when we did not have this much rigorous competition when our neighbour had a reward.</p> <h2 id="we-live-in-a-trust-less-society">We live in a trust less society?</h2> <p>We do not trust our neighbours anymore. TBH I stopped trusting my dad or sister even. There’s no love for others anymore. Of course, I have my reasons.</p> <h2 id="does-abundance-creates-isolation">Does Abundance creates Isolation?</h2> <p>Abundance creates isolation, trust less ness, independence. I read an article about Meadow voles and prairies voles, and their relationships and lifestyles based on their environment. Basically it said that the voles that were in Meadows were sexually promiscuous while their prairies counterparts weren’t. In Meadows, where they would find plenty of food, the voles didn’t care about their relationships, their younger ones, but in prairies, the voles had to gather food and seek food and food wasn’t abundant but scarce, so the male voles were monogamous and even helped the female voles to raise their offsprings, and it was a necessity that they remain monogamous for the survival of their offsprings unlike the meadows voles, where even young voles could easily afford to find food themselves easily. Also, the meadow voles were not very close with each other or socially bonding a lot as much as their prairies counterparts.</p> <p>So, abundance removes the necessity of support from the others, scarcity connects people together on the basis of needs.</p> <p>As world moves forward we will be only abundant in all areas making us all independent of each other and totally trust less. And when there is jealousy and other negative traits then average people lose their trustworthiness.</p> <h2 id="how-to-navigate-a-trust-less-society">How to navigate a trust less society?</h2> <p>We need to use the principles of blockchain technology here. The blockchain technology is used for transacting without a central trust system. They use a special network where each node has to verify their identity, keep track of transactions and then commit their transactions or contracts. Same way, we could also, verify ourselves, keep track of our commitments and other’s commitments and then enforce our legal agreements to the other person.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.</p>]]></content><author><name>Linda Joe Thadeus</name></author><category term="philosophy"/><category term="grace"/><category term="world"/><category term="words"/><category term="general"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We live in a jealous society?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What happened to me - childhood?</title><link href="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/my-hard-childhood/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What happened to me - childhood?"/><published>2024-09-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/my-hard-childhood</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/my-hard-childhood/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="what-happened-my-pathetic-childhood">What happened?: My Pathetic Childhood</h3> <p>Growing up, I faced significant emotional challenges that deeply affected my self-esteem. My skin problems, emotional stress at home, and feelings of guilt weighed on me for years. But there came a turning point, and this is how I began to overcome it.</p> <h3 id="dependence-and-emotional-boundaries">Dependence and Emotional Boundaries</h3> <p>As a teenager, I relied heavily on my sick mother—not just for support, but to shamelessly hide my despicable self from the world. I was pathetically dependent on my sick mom. I had low self-esteem, worsened by family stress and my insecurities about my skin. <strong>“I wasn’t emotionally secure, and I used my sick mom to hide me from the cruel world, which left me feeling guilty.”</strong></p> <h3 id="guilt-and-trespassing">Guilt and Trespassing</h3> <p>I carried immense guilt. <strong>“I felt guilty for using my mom, was punished unnecessarily for others’ mistakes, and trespassed upon by those around me.”</strong> Lacking boundaries, It wasn’t until I left home that I finally found relief.</p> <h3 id="finding-freedom-and-anonymity">Finding Freedom and Anonymity</h3> <p><strong>“One day, I left that place for a better life.”</strong> The emotional weight lifted when I went away to school. <strong>“Being a student protected me by providing anonymity.”</strong> This new environment, away from the constant stress, allowed me to heal. I was able to focus on myself without being overwhelmed.</p> <h3 id="lessons-in-boundaries-and-self-worth">Lessons in Boundaries and Self-Worth</h3> <p>Looking back, I see how important emotional distance was in rebuilding my self-esteem.
