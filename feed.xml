Cain was farming crops and Abel was rearing sheeps. Cain and Abel were supposed to offer their products to the God, Cain offered probably some average crops for namesake as it was not his first time but Abel being the first time offerer, totally stole the show. Abel offered to the God, the fattest and the best lamb in his farm. Abel hustled hard and was able to make the best of his efforts. Cain’s domain was boring and took too much of his time and he didn’t have enough energy or enthusiasm left in himself to make it his best work, much like the life of an Average Linux Kernel Developer.</p> <p>God received both their offers and was totally pleased with Abel’s. Of course, hardwork pays back. But, the senior one got offended, as Cain, the senior one thought that as usual, God would have selected Cain’s offering and he also thought that God was entitled to accept the offering of the first born son.</p> <p>Then, Abel drunk with pride started showing off and this pissed off his older brother completely. Cain never had hit his baby brother as he knew Abel was too weak and small to fight back and survive and of course Abel was his brother.</p> <p>But that night was different, his baby brother had taken away his dignity as per his opinion. So, when Abel was pissing Cain off, Cain hit him hard. Abel died then and there. He got scared and buried his brother’s body in the woods.</p> <p>So, was working hard or hustling the reason for Abel’s death? Well, not directly, but pissing the stronger brother off definitely was the reason.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.</p>]]></content><author><name>Linda Joe Thadeus</name></author><category term="philosophy"/><category term="grace,"/><category term="dharmam"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why did Cain kill Abel?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Next Jobs</title><link href="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/my-thoughts-on-next-jobs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Next Jobs"/><published>2024-08-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/my-thoughts-on-next-jobs</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/my-thoughts-on-next-jobs/"><![CDATA[<p>Hi Everyone, This is a post about my thoughts on the set of jobs that will be present after the genesis of the AI era.</p> <p>The introduction of AI has shown the world that the average knowledge work does not have to be too costly, much like when the Industrial Machines showed the world that the average hand-made product does not have to be too costly.</p> <p>Let us look at it deeper, what constitutes an average work?

Let’s explore a few additional dimensions to enrich the conversation.</p> <h4 id="clarifying-average-work"><strong>Clarifying ‘Average Work’</strong></h4> <p>You’ve defined “average work” as tasks that don’t require deep thinking and can be replicated through patterns. This is an excellent way to frame the discussion. To make it more relatable, consider providing examples: routine data analysis, content generation based on templates, or handling straightforward customer service queries are all tasks that AI can perform efficiently.</p> <h4 id="job-security-beyond-low-pay"><strong>Job Security Beyond Low Pay</strong></h4> <p>While it’s true that lower-paid knowledge workers might not be the first to be replaced by AI, there’s more to job security than pay. Adaptability, continuous learning, and the ability to collaborate with AI are becoming increasingly crucial. Workers who can integrate AI into their workflow, regardless of their pay scale, will likely be more secure in the long run.</p> <h4 id="niche-and-emerging-technologies-safe-havens"><strong>Niche and Emerging Technologies: Safe Havens?</strong></h4> <p>You’ve rightly pointed out that knowledge workers in unexplored or niche fields are safer. However, it’s essential to emphasize that these workers must remain vigilant by continually updating their skills. Emerging technologies offer opportunities for growth, requiring human ingenuity to develop and refine. Staying ahead of the AI curve involves seeking out new knowledge and expertise.</p> <h4 id="the-role-of-creativity-and-human-touch"><strong>The Role of Creativity and Human Touch</strong></h4> <p>AI excels at pattern recognition and large-scale data processing, but there are areas where human creativity, emotional intelligence, and nuanced decision-making are irreplaceable. These uniquely human traits will continue to play a critical role in the workforce. Emphasizing this can add depth to your argument about the future of work.</p> <h4 id="a-call-to-action"><strong>A Call to Action</strong></h4> <p>To make this discussion more actionable, I encourage readers to assess their careers and identify areas where they can upskill or pivot towards more AI-resistant roles. Whether it’s by embracing creativity, honing expertise in niche fields, or learning how to collaborate with AI, there are steps everyone can take to ensure they remain valuable in the AI era.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.

Avoidant is a person who intensely needs independence.</p> <h4 id="narcissists-and-their-need-for-admiration"><strong>Narcissists and Their Need for Admiration</strong></h4> <p>Narcissists are often characterized by their intense need for admiration. This need isn’t just a desire but a deep-seated requirement that fuels their self-esteem and sense of worth. Narcissists thrive on validation from others, using it as a way to reinforce their self-image and maintain their perceived superiority.</p> <p>However, this constant need for admiration often comes at the expense of genuine, unconditional love. Narcissists may find themselves in relationships where they are admired but not truly loved for who they are. This superficial connection can lead to feelings of emptiness and dissatisfaction, as the external validation they crave never fully satisfies the deeper emotional needs that unconditional love would provide.</p> <p>And, Narcissists often employ not pretty tactics like manipulation, gas-lighting to get what they want, even at the expense of others in a grand way because of their grandiosity needs from the others.</p> <h4 id="avoidants-and-their-need-for-respect"><strong>Avoidants and Their Need for Respect</strong></h4> <p>Avoidants, on the other hand, are driven by a strong need for respect—specifically, respect for their boundaries and autonomy. They value their independence and often keep others at a distance to protect themselves from vulnerability and emotional pain. While this approach helps avoidants feel safe and in control, it also means they may miss out on the deeper emotional connections that come with unconditional love.</p> <p>Unlike narcissists, avoidants don’t necessarily need to be admired or praised; what they truly want is for their space and need for independence to be respected. This focus on maintaining distance can create a barrier to experiencing the kind of deep, unconditional love that requires emotional closeness and vulnerability. As a result, avoidants may suffer from feelings of loneliness or a sense of missing out on the full richness of relationships.</p> <p>And, Avoidants too employ not pretty tactics like manipulation, gas-lighting to get what they want, even at the expense of others but very subtly because of their freewill, empathetic needs from the others and maybe that is why avoidants are not hated as much as their narcissist sibling.</p> <h4 id="the-common-ground-conditional-needs"><strong>The Common Ground: Conditional Needs</strong></h4> <p>Both narcissists and avoidants suffer because their primary needs—admiration for narcissists and respect for avoidants—often overshadow their need for unconditional love. For narcissists, the endless pursuit of admiration doesn’t fulfill their deeper emotional needs, leaving them in a perpetual state of dissatisfaction. For avoidants, the safety and security of maintaining distance can lead to a lack of deep, fulfilling connections, resulting in loneliness and emotional isolation.</p> <h4 id="when-can-they-both-be-good-people-for-others"><strong>When can they both be good people for others?</strong></h4> <p>Contrary to popular belief they both can be good to others, but terms and conditions applied. Basically, as long as the grandiosity needs are fulfilled, a narcissist is the best parent, partner. Similarly, An avoidant is the best parent and partner, when their freewill needs are fulfilled.</p> <p>Ultimately, by acknowledging and addressing these underlying needs, both narcissists and avoidants can work towards healthier, more fulfilling relationships that provide not just what they want, but what they truly need.</p>]]></content><author><name>Linda Joe Thadeus</name></author><category term="psychology"/><category term="relationships"/><category term="grace"/><category term="Narcissism"/><category term="Avoidant Attachment"/><category term="Relationships"/><category term="Psychology"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, Today we are going to understand 2 different personality styles, a Narcissist and an Avoidant.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to setup github pages?</title><link href="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/my-first-post/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to setup github pages?"/><published>2024-08-19T05:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-19T05:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/my-first-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/my-first-post/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="how-to-setup-github-pages">How to setup github pages?</h1> <p>This is my first post on my new Jekyll-powered website.</p> <p>In this post, we will look at the steps to create a website using github pages.
