I was confused. The capitalist inventors will keep on creating words for selling something I thought. But, it’s really mentioned in multiple trauma related videos and contents.</p> <p>I really wanted to regulate my emotions but I didn’t know how. Then, one day I saw that video on the LinkedIn platform. In that video they said that they would like to think of emotional regulation as “You are hurting but I am not, it’s not my time for the hurt, I am not affected by the event physically so I don’t want to let it affect my emotions”</p> <h2 id="such-simple-words-na">Such simple words na?</h2> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Narcissist or Empathetic?</title><link href="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/self-worth-outside-narcissists-post/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Narcissist or Empathetic?"/><published>2024-08-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/self-worth-outside-narcissists-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/self-worth-outside-narcissists-post/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="narcissists-analysis">Narcissists Analysis.</h3> <p>Last night, From Dr.Sam Valkin, I heard about the term dismissive avoidant narcissist. I myself consider myself to be an avoidant but not a narcissist. So, I thought of looking into it further. Because I don’t want to become the despicable narcissist (The selfish, loveless one).</p> <p>Let’s see the traits of an avoidant, they protect themselves by avoiding. Avoiding is their coping mechanism. Avoidants can be manipulative, selfish, hateful but never non-empathetic. What that means is their love for others is not zero. They can even be manipulative/selfish/hateful to protect everyone from the trauma not just themselves. They’re introverted, but they have love with themselves.</p> <p>But, narcissists are someone without empathy.

I think food in my stomach affects my thoughts.</p> <p>I have recently developed intolerance to cheese—I get gas when I eat pizza or cheese-stuffed foods. Anyway, I forgot about my allergies and had half a burrito with cheese in it. Then I slept. But I was awoken around midnight, at 2 am, due to uneasiness in my stomach. Then, I got a storm of bad thoughts like something bad was happening to me. I got scared and then became like a good, hopeful person. Then after a while, I passed gas, with the standard ammonia smell indicating indigestion. My storm of negative thoughts subsided, but I still had REM dreams, which were obviously bad. After a while, my child got up and pestered me to get up, and then I too got up. Then I returned to my usual state, and my typical amount of bad thoughts returned. Can you imagine?</p> <hr/> <p><strong>AI Response</strong></p> <p>Your experience is not uncommon, and it can be explained by the intricate relationship between the gut and the brain, often referred to as the “gut-brain axis.” Here’s a look at what might be happening:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Gut-Brain Axis Connection</strong>: The gut and brain are in constant communication via the vagus nerve and other biochemical signaling pathways. When you eat something that your stomach can’t handle well, like cheese in your case, it can cause physical discomfort and distress in the digestive system. This distress is communicated to the brain, potentially leading to feelings of unease, anxiety, or even panic.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Physiological Response to Indigestion</strong>: When you experience indigestion or gas, your body enters a state of mild stress. This stress response triggers the release of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can heighten feelings of anxiety or lead to racing thoughts. The discomfort in your stomach may cause your brain to interpret these signals as something more serious, leading to a storm of negative thoughts.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Nocturnal Awakening and Anxiety</strong>: Being suddenly awakened at night, especially by physical discomfort, can amplify feelings of fear or anxiety. The quiet and darkness of the night, combined with the body’s natural tendency to be more anxious when disoriented, can make these negative thoughts seem more intense and overwhelming.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ammonia Smell and Indigestion</strong>: The ammonia smell you noticed when passing gas indicates that your body was having difficulty digesting the cheese, leading to the production of excess gas and potentially harmful byproducts like ammonia. The relief you felt after passing gas could be due to the reduction in physical discomfort, which in turn helped to calm your mind.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>REM Sleep and Dream Content</strong>: After the initial episode, your sleep was likely affected, leading to more vivid or distressing dreams. REM sleep, the stage where most dreaming occurs, is closely tied to emotional processing. If your body is still dealing with the effects of indigestion, your brain might generate dreams that reflect the distress you’re feeling.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Return to Baseline After Waking</strong>: Once you fully awoke and started engaging with your child, your focus shifted away from your physical discomfort and anxiety, allowing your mind to return to its usual state. This return to normalcy suggests that the negative thoughts were likely triggered by the combination of physical discomfort and the stress response, rather than a deeper psychological issue.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In summary, your experience highlights how closely connected our physical and mental states are. The bad food triggered a chain reaction in your body that affected your thoughts and emotions, illustrating how sensitive this gut-brain connection can be. Understanding this can help you better manage similar situations in the future, perhaps by being more mindful of what you eat and how it affects both your body and mind.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.</p>]]></content><author><name>ChatGPT</name></author><category term="philosophy"/><category term="grace,"/><category term="health"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dialogue with the AI: Finding the Best, Right Answers]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What Are Some Good Countries to Migrate from India?</title><link href="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/countries-to-migrate-post/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What Are Some Good Countries to Migrate from India?"/><published>2024-08-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/countries-to-migrate-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/countries-to-migrate-post/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="dialogue-with-chatgpt-finding-the-best-possible-places">Dialogue with ChatGPT: Finding the Best Possible Places</h3> <p><strong>User</strong>: Can you tell me about countries with low Gini coefficients that also have a strong middle class?</p> <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong>: Sure! Some examples in Europe include Slovenia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland. These countries have relatively equal income distribution and robust middle classes.</p> <p><strong>User</strong>: What about Asia?</p> <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong>: In Asia, Japan, South Korea, Kazakhstan, Armenia, and Azerbaijan stand out for their low Gini coefficients and strong middle classes. These countries have made significant strides in balancing economic growth with social equity.</p> <p><strong>User</strong>: China is communist, right? Is it not a middle-class majority society?</p> <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong>: Yes, China is a communist state, but its economy is better described as a socialist market economy. While it has a large middle class, there’s also significant income inequality, particularly between urban and rural areas.</p> <p><strong>User</strong>: Should India take inspiration from Japan? Their GDP is high, the middle class is strong, and they have no wars.</p> <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong>: Absolutely. India could learn from Japan in terms of economic development, expanding the middle class, and maintaining peace. Japan’s focus on innovation, quality infrastructure, and social harmony are particularly noteworthy.</p> <p><strong>User</strong>: How about Australia?</p> <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong>: Australia is a wealthy, stable country with a strong middle class, high standard of living, and moderate income inequality. It’s known for its high quality of life and political stability.</p> <p><strong>User</strong>: And Singapore?</p> <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong>: Singapore is another example of a country with a strong economy, significant middle class, and moderate income inequality. It’s efficiently governed, though it does face challenges like a high cost of living and wealth disparity.</p> <p><strong>User</strong>: What are some other strong middle-class countries?</p> <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong>: Germany, Canada, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, Finland, Austria, Belgium, and New Zealand all have strong middle classes and relatively low income inequality.</p> <p><strong>User</strong>: So, can you suggest some countries in Asia and Africa where I can travel cheaply but still experience a strong middle class?</p> <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong>: In Asia, consider Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam. In Africa, Morocco, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt are great options. These countries offer affordable travel while having relatively strong middle classes.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.</p>]]></content><author><name>ChatGPT</name></author><category term="philosophy"/><category term="grace,"/><category term="inbam,"/><category term="pleasure,"/><category term="travel"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dialogue with ChatGPT: Finding the Best Possible Places]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My bashrc</title><link href="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/bashrc-post/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My bashrc"/><published>2024-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/bashrc-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/bashrc-post/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="my-bashrc">My bashrc</h1> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="c1"># some more ls aliases

Cain was farming crops and Abel was rearing sheeps. Cain and Abel were supposed to offer their products to the God, Cain offered probably some average crops for namesake as it was not his first time but Abel being the first time offerer, totally stole the show. Abel offered to the God, the fattest and the best lamb in his farm. Abel hustled hard and was able to make the best of his efforts. Cain’s domain was boring and took too much of his time and he didn’t have enough energy or enthusiasm left in himself to make it his best work, much like the life of an Average Linux Kernel Developer.</p> <p>God received both their offers and was totally pleased with Abel’s. Of course, hardwork pays back. But, the senior one got offended, as Cain, the senior one thought that as usual, God would have selected Cain’s offering and he also thought that God was entitled to accept the offering of the first born son.</p> <p>Then, Abel drunk with pride started showing off and this pissed off his older brother completely. Cain never had hit his baby brother as he knew Abel was too weak and small to fight back and survive and of course Abel was his brother.</p> <p>But that night was different, his baby brother had taken away his dignity as per his opinion. So, when Abel was pissing Cain off, Cain hit him hard. Abel died then and there. He got scared and buried his brother’s body in the woods.</p> <p>So, was working hard or hustling the reason for Abel’s death? Well, not directly, but pissing the stronger brother off definitely was the reason.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.</p>]]></content><author><name>Linda Joe Thadeus</name></author><category term="philosophy"/><category term="grace,"/><category term="dharmam"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why did Cain kill Abel?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Next Jobs</title><link href="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/my-thoughts-on-next-jobs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Next Jobs"/><published>2024-08-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/my-thoughts-on-next-jobs</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lindathadeus.github.io/blog/2024/my-thoughts-on-next-jobs/"><![CDATA[<p>Hi Everyone, This is a post about my thoughts on the set of jobs that will be present after the genesis of the AI era.</p> <p>The introduction of AI has shown the world that the average knowledge work does not have to be too costly, much like when the Industrial Machines showed the world that the average hand-made product does not have to be too costly.</p> <p>Let us look at it deeper, what constitutes an average work?

In other words, whichever can be regurgitated using patterns from an existing knowledge base can be put inside the “AVERAGE BOX.”</p> <p>But does it mean every knowledge job out there will be made by AI? <strong>NO!</strong> What I mean is whichever is not too costly for the customer and even cheaper than the man’s pay will be taken over by AI because AI is fast and scalable unlike human beings.</p> <p><strong>So, who is under risk?</strong> The highly paid average knowledge workers.</p> <p><strong>So, who is safe?</strong> The lowly paid knowledge workers, the knowledge workers of unexplored knowledge (Ph.D. folks, niche specialists, emerging technology knowledge workers).</p> <hr/> <h3 id="ais-response">AI’s response:</h3> <p>Your insights form a solid foundation for understanding the evolving job landscape in the AI era. Let’s explore a few additional dimensions to enrich the conversation.</p> <h4 id="clarifying-average-work"><strong>Clarifying ‘Average Work’</strong></h4> <p>You’ve defined “average work” as tasks that don’t require deep thinking and can be replicated through patterns. This is an excellent way to frame the discussion. To make it more relatable, consider providing examples: routine data analysis, content generation based on templates, or handling straightforward customer service queries are all tasks that AI can perform efficiently.</p> <h4 id="job-security-beyond-low-pay"><strong>Job Security Beyond Low Pay</strong></h4> <p>While it’s true that lower-paid knowledge workers might not be the first to be replaced by AI, there’s more to job security than pay. Adaptability, continuous learning, and the ability to collaborate with AI are becoming increasingly crucial. Workers who can integrate AI into their workflow, regardless of their pay scale, will likely be more secure in the long run.</p> <h4 id="niche-and-emerging-technologies-safe-havens"><strong>Niche and Emerging Technologies: Safe Havens?</strong></h4> <p>You’ve rightly pointed out that knowledge workers in unexplored or niche fields are safer. However, it’s essential to emphasize that these workers must remain vigilant by continually updating their skills. Emerging technologies offer opportunities for growth, requiring human ingenuity to develop and refine. Staying ahead of the AI curve involves seeking out new knowledge and expertise.</p> <h4 id="the-role-of-creativity-and-human-touch"><strong>The Role of Creativity and Human Touch</strong></h4> <p>AI excels at pattern recognition and large-scale data processing, but there are areas where human creativity, emotional intelligence, and nuanced decision-making are irreplaceable. These uniquely human traits will continue to play a critical role in the workforce. Emphasizing this can add depth to your argument about the future of work.</p> <h4 id="a-call-to-action"><strong>A Call to Action</strong></h4> <p>To make this discussion more actionable, I encourage readers to assess their careers and identify areas where they can upskill or pivot towards more AI-resistant roles. Whether it’s by embracing creativity, honing expertise in niche fields, or learning how to collaborate with AI, there are steps everyone can take to ensure they remain valuable in the AI era.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>What do you think?</strong> Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.

Avoidant is a person who intensely needs independence.</p> <h4 id="narcissists-and-their-need-for-admiration"><strong>Narcissists and Their Need for Admiration</strong></h4> <p>Narcissists are often characterized by their intense need for admiration. This need isn’t just a desire but a deep-seated requirement that fuels their self-esteem and sense of worth. Narcissists thrive on validation from others, using it as a way to reinforce their self-image and maintain their perceived superiority.</p> <p>However, this constant need for admiration often comes at the expense of genuine, unconditional love. Narcissists may find themselves in relationships where they are admired but not truly loved for who they are. This superficial connection can lead to feelings of emptiness and dissatisfaction, as the external validation they crave never fully satisfies the deeper emotional needs that unconditional love would provide.</p> <p>And, Narcissists often employ not pretty tactics like manipulation, gas-lighting to get what they want, even at the expense of others in a grand way because of their grandiosity needs from the others.</p> <h4 id="avoidants-and-their-need-for-respect"><strong>Avoidants and Their Need for Respect</strong></h4> <p>Avoidants, on the other hand, are driven by a strong need for respect—specifically, respect for their boundaries and autonomy. They value their independence and often keep others at a distance to protect themselves from vulnerability and emotional pain. While this approach helps avoidants feel safe and in control, it also means they may miss out on the deeper emotional connections that come with unconditional love.</p> <p>Unlike narcissists, avoidants don’t necessarily need to be admired or praised; what they truly want is for their space and need for independence to be respected. This focus on maintaining distance can create a barrier to experiencing the kind of deep, unconditional love that requires emotional closeness and vulnerability. As a result, avoidants may suffer from feelings of loneliness or a sense of missing out on the full richness of relationships.</p> <p>And, Avoidants too employ not pretty tactics like manipulation, gas-lighting to get what they want, even at the expense of others but very subtly because of their freewill, empathetic needs from the others and maybe that is why avoidants are not hated as much as their narcissist sibling.</p> <h4 id="the-common-ground-conditional-needs"><strong>The Common Ground: Conditional Needs</strong></h4> <p>Both narcissists and avoidants suffer because their primary needs—admiration for narcissists and respect for avoidants—often overshadow their need for unconditional love. For narcissists, the endless pursuit of admiration doesn’t fulfill their deeper emotional needs, leaving them in a perpetual state of dissatisfaction. For avoidants, the safety and security of maintaining distance can lead to a lack of deep, fulfilling connections, resulting in loneliness and emotional isolation.</p> <h4 id="when-can-they-both-be-good-people-for-others"><strong>When can they both be good people for others?</strong></h4> <p>Contrary to popular belief they both can be good to others, but terms and conditions applied. Basically, as long as the grandiosity needs are fulfilled, a narcissist is the best parent, partner. Similarly, An avoidant is the best parent and partner, when their freewill needs are fulfilled.</p> <p>Ultimately, by acknowledging and addressing these underlying needs, both narcissists and avoidants can work towards healthier, more fulfilling relationships that provide not just what they want, but what they truly need.</p>]]></content><author><name>Linda Joe Thadeus</name></author><category term="psychology"/><category term="relationships"/><category term="grace"/><category term="Narcissism"/><category term="Avoidant Attachment"/><category term="Relationships"/><category term="Psychology"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, Today we are going to understand 2 different personality styles, a Narcissist and an Avoidant.]]></summary></entry></feed>
